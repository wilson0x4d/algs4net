## Summary

A few fundamental algorithms implemented via C# using .NET Standard 2.0-compatible projects and language features.

**Why?**

Because a refresher on algorithms never hurts, public critique will help me learn/improve, and others looking for examples of these algorithms written in C# may find this repo a useful learning resource.
